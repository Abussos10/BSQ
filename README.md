# BSQ

The goal of this project is to find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board can be generated two ways :
- The first one is by reading a file passed as the programâ€™s argument.
- The second way to obtain a board is to generate one based on given parameters. The parameters will be a number, representing the width and height of the board, and a pattern that will be repeated line by line along the board
